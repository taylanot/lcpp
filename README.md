# lcpp [LearningCurvePlusPlus]

![](docs/figures/logo.svg)

**C++ Header-Only Learning Curve Generation Tool**  

Generate learning curves for supervised machine learning algorithms with just header files â€” no separate compilation needed!  

`lcpp` is designed to help you easily generate learning curves for supervised ML algorithms.  
It provides a clean C++ header-only implementation, making it easy to integrate into your own projects without heavy build setup.

## Quick Start  

Get started quickly with **lcpp**. You can install it locally:
```bash
./install.sh
```
However, I highly recommend using the pre-built image with your preferred container platform. You can pull the pre-built image from Docker Hub:
```bash
singularity pull lcpp.sif docker://taylanot/lcpp
```
Once installed, include lcpp in your program by adding the following at the top of your source file:
```cpp
#include <lcpp.h>
```

You can build your project using the provided sample Makefile or your own. The sample Makefile will create a build directory and place your executable there:
```bash
singularity lcpp.sif make your_project
```
Now, you are ready to run you program...
```bash
build/your_project
```
